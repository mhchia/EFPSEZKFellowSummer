## [Summary](#summary)

The Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) program offered by Ethereum Foundation's Privacy Scaling & Explorations (PSE) presents a remarkable opportunity to delve into the captivating realm of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Under the guidance of the experienced experts at PSE, participants will gain hands-on experience in this cutting-edge field.

During the program, we will embark on a self-learning journey, gradually progressing from foundational knowledge to exploring advanced use-cases and applications of ZKP. Over the course of approximately three weeks, we will dive deep into the protocols and applications developed by EF PSE, allowing us to develop a comprehensive understanding of this intriguing subject.

Throughout the program, there will be ample opportunities for further exploration and learning. Additional resources, such as articles, videos, and research papers, will be provided to enhance our understanding of ZKP. These resources cover a wide range of topics, including the different types of ZKP, use cases, implementation strategies, and real-world examples of enterprises utilizing this protocol.

The program is designed to foster a collaborative learning environment, where participants can engage in discussions, seek guidance from mentors, and exchange ideas with fellow learners. By the end of the program, participants will not only have a solid foundation in ZKP but will also be equipped with the knowledge and skills to implement ZKP architectures.

This program is a gateway to a new era of privacy and security, where the power of decentralized systems and advanced cryptographic techniques converge. Get ready to embark on this exciting journey into the world of Zero Knowledge Proofs and unlock the potential of this transformative technology.

Here is a brief look into the self learning [curriculum](https://github.com/thogiti/EFPSEZKFellowSummer/blob/main/images/curriculum.png)


## [Introduction to ZKP Module 1](https://github.com/thogiti/EFPSEZKFellowSummer/tree/main/Module%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20ZK)

In the module 1, we will learn the concept of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), how they work, and some simple explanations/analogies to further understand the concept of ZKP and how they can be used as a tool to solve many varieties of problems.
